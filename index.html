      <h2 id="hi-its-nice-to-meet-you" class="is-size-2 mt-2">Hi! It&rsquo;s nice to meet you!</h2>
      <p>We just moved in at <em>40 Hill Street</em> and we&rsquo;re excited to meet our neighbors!</p>
      <p>We&rsquo;re Jack and Kiersten Case, and we just moved from our apartment in Newton to
        our very own house. We&rsquo;re busy unpacking, but we wanted to introduce ourselves.
        Besides us two, we have three very spoiled pet rabbits named Chester, Phoebe,
        and Anton. Chester and Phoebe are bonded and love one another very much, but
        Anton prefers the bachelor life.</p>
