# Hi! It's nice to meet you!

We just moved in at *40 Hill Street* and we're excited to meet our neighbors!

We're Jack and Kiersten Case, and we just moved from our apartment in Newton to
our very own house. We're busy unpacking, but we wanted to introduce ourselves.

## Jack
I'm a full-time software engineer at *Pratt and Whitney* located just a few minutes
from here. Outside of work I enjoy photography, pinball, board games, biking and
rollerblading. You can learn more about me by following me on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@GandalfDG) (It's like Twitter used to be), [Pixelfed](https://pixtagram.social/gandalfdg) (ditto for Instagram), and on my own website which is part resume, part personal
blog: [jack-case.pro](https://jack-case.pro).
