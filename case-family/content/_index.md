## Hi! It's nice to meet you!

<div class="columns">
<div class="column">
We just moved in on <em>Hill Street</em> and we're excited to meet our neighbors!
We're Jack and Kiersten Case, and we just moved from our apartment in Newton to
our very own house. We're busy unpacking, but we wanted to introduce ourselves.
Besides us two, we have three very spoiled pet rabbits named Chester, Phoebe,
and Anton. Chester and Phoebe are bonded and love one another very much, but
Anton prefers the bachelor life.

        I'm a full-time software engineer at <em>Pratt and Whitney</em> located just a few
        minutes from here. Outside of work I enjoy photography, pinball, board games,
        biking and rollerblading. You can learn more about me by following me on
        <a href="https://indieweb.social/@GandalfDG">Mastodon</a> (It's like Twitter used to be),
        <a href="https://pixtagram.social/gandalfdg">Pixelfed</a> (ditto for Instagram), and on my
        own website which is part resume, part personal blog:

        I'm an elementary music teacher, and I'm developing a TV show for kids called
        <em>Lilypad Library</em>. I also write music and perform at the Early Risers storytime
        at <em>The Blue Bunny</em> in Dedham. Outside of my work I like to ski, crochet, play
        cozy video games, and more. Visit my website
        to check out my music and TV work: <a href="https://mskiersten.com">mskiersten.com</a>
